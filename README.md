## Basic info
This is a class project for Stanford CS231A, which detects the direction of a lane. This is a reimplementation of the closed source project "Lane detection and tracking using B-Snake" by Yue Wang, Eam Khwang Teoha, Dinggang Shen.
## Contributors 
Contributors are Kaixin Chen and Shunyao Xu. Kaixin Chen is incharge of the Canny-Hough-Estimation-of-Vanishing-Points (CHEVP) algorithm used for lane detection, parameter tunning and a RANSAC function used by CHEVP. Shunyao Xu is incharge of implementing Hough transform and Canny edge detector used by CHEVP (these two functions basically serve the same function as cv2.HoughP() and cv2.canny()), parameter tunning and evaluation. 
## How to use
Run the Lane_Detection_Through_Spline jupyter notebooks to perform lane detection.
